- **App Name:** Hue: Minimalist Color Timer
- **Short Description:** Focus through colors. A minimalist, gesture-based timer for deep work.
- **Full Description:**
"Hue" is a revolutionary, minimalist timer designed to help you focus without the clutter of traditional tools. No buttons, no complex settings, and no aggressive ticking—just colors and time.

**Key Features:**
- **Gesture-Driven UX:** Swipe up to set time and watch the screen transform through a vivid color spectrum. Swipe down to decrease.
- **Visual Focus:** Instead of watching seconds tick away, feel the passage of time through shifting hues.
- **The "Pulse":** A subtle, calming breathe animation keeps you aware that your focus session is active without causing "time anxiety".
- **Hardcore Minimalism:** A completely clean interface that hides itself when you're working, keeping you in the zone.
- **Reliable Notifications:** Get notified exactly when your time is up, even if the app is minimized or the screen is locked.
- **Haptic Feedback:** Feel every minute with precise, gentle vibrations as you set your goals.

Whether you're practicing Pomodoro, meditating, or just need a clean kitchen timer, Hue provides a zen-like experience for your productivity.

Time in technicolor. Focus with Hue.
