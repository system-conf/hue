# Privacy Policy for Hue

Last Updated: February 24, 2026

Hue ("the App") is a minimalist timer application. We value your privacy, and our philosophy is built on collecting as little information as possible.

## 1. Data Collection
**Hue does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.** 
- We do not require account creation.
- We do not track your location.
- We do not collect information about your device or how you use the app.
- We do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.

## 2. Permissions
- **Notifications:** The App asks for notification permission solely to alert you when your timer has finished. This is handled locally on your device.
- **Vibration/Haptics:** Used locally to provide feedback when setting or finishing a timer.

## 3. Third-Party Services
The App does not share any information with third-party services.

## 4. Children's Privacy
Since we do not collect any personal information from any user, including children under the age of 13, the App is fully compliant with children's privacy regulations.

## 5. Contact Us
