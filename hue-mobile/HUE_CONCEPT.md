# HUE - Minimalist Timer Concept

Hue is a minimalist productivity tool designed to reduce "time anxiety" by using color metaphors and simple gestures instead of complex interfaces.

## Core Philosophy: "Hardcore Minimalism"
Most timer apps overwhelm the user with buttons, settings, and aggressive ticking sounds. **Hue** removes everything that isn't essential. It transforms time into a visual spectrum.

## Application Logic
- **Visual Feedback:** The background color is a direct representation of the time set. 
  - **Green:** Fresh start, short focus (1-10 mins).
  - **Yellow/Orange:** Deep work, steady pace (10-30 mins).
  - **Red:** Intense focus, long sessions (30-60 mins).
- **The "Pulse":** When active, the screen subtly breathes (pulsates). This gives the user a calm assurance that time is flowing without the stress of a ticking clock.
- **Gesture-Driven UX:**
  - **Swipe Up/Down:** Gravity-based time setting.
  - **Single Tap:** State toggle (Start/Pause).
  - **Long Press:** Absolute reset.
- **Background Reliability:** Even if the app is closed, it uses native OS notifications to ensure the user is alerted exactly when their session ends.

## Design Identity
- **Font:** Ultra-light weight typography.
- **Spacing:** Extreme use of negative space.
- **Interactions:** Subtle haptic feedback for every meaningful action to provide a "physical" feel to a digital product.

# Logo & Branding Recommendations

To maintain the "Hue" identity, the logo should be abstract and focus on the color gradient or the concept of a "cycle".

## DALL-E / Midjourney Prompts

### Option 1: Minimalist Icon (Gradient Focused)
> "A minimalist mobile app icon for a timer app named 'Hue'. The design is a perfect circle with a smooth, vibrant color gradient transitioning from neon green to deep red. The background is pitch black. Flat design, premium look, Apple App Store style, 4k, high resolution."

### Option 2: Abstract Flow (Motion Focused)
> "Abstract logo representing time and color. A single, elegant thin white line forming a continuous loop on a multicolor gradient background. Minimalist, zen aesthetic, sophisticated, symmetrical, high-end tech branding."

### Option 3: Lettermark (Typography Focused)
> "A luxury logo icon featuring the letter 'H' in a thin, elegant, modern sans-serif font. The 'H' is transparent, showing a beautiful rainbow gradient underneath. Set against a minimalist dark gray background. Sleek, clean, professional."

## Branding Tips
- **App Store Screenshots:** Use high-contrast images. Show a completely green screen, a yellow screen, and a red screen with the numbers in the middle. Let the colors speak for themselves.
- **Tagline:** "Time in Technicolor" or "Focus through Color".
